             <h1> Client Terms of Service</h1>

            <p>This agreement is between Gradsuccess.org, Ltd ("Gradsuccess") and its clients who have purchased services from Gradsuccess. Unless the context requires otherwise, Gradsuccess and/or its assigns shall be referred to as "us, we, or our" and the client shall be referred to as "you or your." </p>
            <ol>
            <li>You acknowledge that you are the applicant, will write all essays and application materials, and are responsible for all aspects of the essays, resumes, and/or other documents. Gradsuccess does NOT write, draft, compose, or complete essays, and it does not “put notes together.” </li>

          <li>You will not hold Gradsuccess, its officers, consultants, and representatives liable for any denied admissions to any undergraduate, graduate or professional program or school or any denial of employment.</li>


          <li>We have made NO representations about what our service will do for your chances of admission to any undergraduate, graduate or professional school or program or for your chances of employment at any institution, corporation, business, or government agency.</li>

          <li>Services described on Gradsuccess’s website, gradsuccess.org, that are purchased by client from Gradsuccess are provided "AS IS" without any warranty of any kind, either express or implied. In no event will Gradsuccess, its officers, directors, employees, consultants, and representatives be held liable for any damages of any kind, including without limitation compensatory, direct, indirect, or consequential damages, loss of income or data, loss of or damage to property, and claims of third parties arising from any clients' rejection from any undergraduate, graduate, or professional program of any kind. Gradsuccess disclaims any and all implied or express warranties, including but not limited to, the essays', resumes', or letters' fitness for a particular purpose and your fitness for any job or undergraduate, graduate or professional program.</li>


          <li>All services are prepaid. Gradsuccess will not provide services unless you have first paid for the services and agreed to our Terms of Service.</li>

          <li> Gradsuccess’s services can be divided into three categories, i.e., hourly plans and the following two types of flat-rate packages: “One-Year-Application-Cycle Packages” and “Multi-Year Packages.” 
          “Multi-Year Packages,” i.e., The Pre-Med Consulting Package and the Complete College Application Package.
          “One-Year-Application-Cycle Packages,” i.e., all other flat-rate packages, including but not limited to individual and multiple application packages, AMCAS, MD/PHD, masters, and Ph.D. packages, essay packages, resume packages, and interview packages. One Year-Application-Cycle Packages must be used in the application cycle of purchase. Use of these packages after the application cycle of purchase will result in additional charges.</li>

          <li>You understand and agree to our refund policy, which is as follows:
          Gradsuccess does not issue refunds for work already performed.
          We charge a non-refundable service charge for both Standard and Flash services, one-time minimum.
          From the date of purchase, you have up to one year to request a refund for unused services. Gradsuccess will not process refunds that are requested more than one year after the date of purchase.
          If you purchase a Standard or Flash plan and request a refund within one year following the date of purchase, Gradsuccess will calculate your refund as follows: The Amount Paid – [Non-Discounted, Current Service Rate * Time]. “Time” is the time your consultant(s) provided services for you. Time will be at least one hour, currently charged at $10
          If you purchase one or more flat-rate packages and request a refund within one year following the date of purchase, Gradsuccess will calculate your refund as follows: 95% of The Amount Paid – [Non-Discounted, Current Service Rate* Estimated Time]. Estimated Time will always be at least one hour.
          If we need to process a refund via any means other than the credit card or Paypal account with which you paid, Gradsuccess will deduct from the refund a processing fee.</li>

          <li> Service Expiration: Unless you purchased a Custome Package, all work must be completed within two years of purchase or you lose the unused portion of the services that you purchased.</li>
           
          <li>You agree to pay Gradsuccess a Missed Appointment Fee of $20 for each appointment that is missed entirely or cancelled by you less than two hours prior to the scheduled appointment time.</li>

          <li> While we are happy to explain our services to parents or other potential payors, Gradsuccess does not work with parents, siblings, or other applicant proxies. Unless you are a recommender purchasing a letter of recommendation service or an applicant purchasing a letter of recommendation service for your recommender, our client is always the applicant.</li>


          <li>Gradsuccess reserves the right to refuse service to anyone.</li>

          <li> Any and all disputes arising under this agreement and not resolved through negotiation shall be resolved through binding arbitration according to the rules of the Nigerian Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1990. The arbitration shall take place in Lagos State, Nigeria, at the Court of Appeal. The decision of the arbitrator shall be final and binding on the parties and may be entered and enforced in any court of common jurisdiction by either party. If there is any legal action arising from this Agreement, the prevailing party will be entitled to receive reasonable attorney and expert witness fees and costs.</li>

          <li> Unless otherwise specified herein, this agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the client and Gradsuccess with respect to the services purchased by the client from Gradsuccess and it supersedes all prior or contemporaneous communications and proposals, whether electronic, oral or written, between the client and Gradsuccess with respect to the services purchased. This Agreement shall be interpreted through its plain and literal meaning and shall be construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Lagos.</li>

          <li> Gradsuccess may revise and update the prices of the services that it offers at any time without notice.</li>

          <li>Gradsuccess may revise and update these Terms of Service from time to time in our sole discretion. All changes are effective immediately when we post them on our website, and apply to all purchases of services made after they are posted.</li>
