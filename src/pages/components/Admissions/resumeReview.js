                <p> For recruitments, career fairs and admissions, the resume is a powerful tool which can be a deal-breaker for candidates looking to go past initial screening stages to actually clinch an offer. This is no surprise because with initial glances averaging 6 seconds, impressions are already being made by admission panellists, HR personnel and even the computer bot who will be perusing these one-pagers.</p>
                <p> If you want to stand out in todayâ€™s competitive climes, your resume should be outstanding, precise, and engaging altogether.</p>
